# Hello! I'm Jordan and welcome to my GitHub Profile! 👋🏻

My repos are full of fun data science (DS) projects that I  work on in my free time. 😄

## A Little Bit About Myself:

- 💼 I work as a Data Scientist for an online dating company 💕
- 🌱 Currently learning a bit of everything!
- 🎸 When I'm not doing data things, I play guitar in a rock band!
- 🗓 2023 Goal: I'm new to GitHub, so my goal is to make weekly contributions.

## Notable repos on my profile to consider:

- *[Web Scraping Pokemon Data](https://github.com/JordanEisinger/pokemon-web-scraping)*
